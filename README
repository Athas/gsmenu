`gsmenu` - a generic visual menu
================================

`gsmenu` is a program that reads a list of entries from standard input
(one per line) and provides a visual, grid-based interface from which
the user can select one, with either mouse or keyboard.  The manual
page contains full documentation.

Installation
------------

Assuming a working Cabal install, just do 'cabal install'.  Any
missing dependencies will automatically be downloaded and installed.
You may have to perform a 'cabal update' first to ensure that your
package list is up to date.

Inspiration
-----------

This program is mostly a port of the GridSelect contrib for XMonad by
Clemens Fruhwirth.
