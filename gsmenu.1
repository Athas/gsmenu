.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Overview
gsmenu is a generic grid menu for X11, originally a port of the
GridSelect contrib for XMonad.  It displays elements as a grid of
rectangular cells.
.SS Options
.TP
.B \-d
specifies the X server to contact.
.TP
.B \-c
makes gsmenu accept complex input format (see below).
.TP
.B \-e
print the selected item as an index into the (0-indexed) sequence of
input elements.
.TP
.B \-h
The height of each cell.
.TP
.B \-w
The width of each cell.
.TP
.B \-p
The inner text padding of each cell.
.TP
.B \-x
Set the horizontal position of the center cell as a proportion of the
screen width.
.TP
.B \-y
As \-x, but sets the vertical position.
.TP
.B \-\-font
The first line of elements is printed in this font.  Both traditional
X11-font-strings and XFT-fonts are accepted, the latter when prefixed
with "xft:" (for example "xft:URW Bookman L-10").
.TP
.B \-\-subfont
As \-\-font, but used for secondary lines of elements.
.TP
.B \-\-inputfont
As \-\-font, but affects the user input text field.
.TP
.B \-h
prints command option summary to standard output, then exits.
.TP
.B \-v
prints version information to standard output, then exits.
.SH USAGE
gsmenu reads a list of newline-separated elements from standard input
and presents them in a grid.  Each element has a foreground and a
background colour, as well as a name (what will be visible on the
screen) and a list of tags that can be used for filtering.
.SS INPUT FORMAT
In the "simple" input format (the default), each line corresponds to
the name of a single element and each element has an empty set of
tags.  In the "complex" input format, entries take the form of
key-value pairs, with the key being a sequence of alphanumerics,
followed by an equals sign, followed by a value in double quotes
(double-quotes can be embedded in values by doubling them).  For
example, an element might be

.nf
name="foo" bg="red"
.fi

And a list-value can be given by simply writing more double-quoted
strings (this also showcases double quote-escaping):

.nf
name="quote ""this"" please" tags="bar" "baz" bg="red"
.fi

The following keys are defined:
.TP
.B name
The string that will be displayed in the grid.  The value can also be
a list, in which case each part of the list will be printed as a line
by itself (note that there will probably not be room for more than two
lines).  Also, only the first line will count as the "name" as far as
selection output is concerned.
.TP
.B fg
The foreground (text) colour of the element (#RGB, #RRGGBB, and color
names are supported).
.TP
.B bg
The background colour of the element (#RGB, #RRGGBB, and color
names are supported).
.TP
.B tags
A list of tags of the element, used when filtering.

.SS INTERACTION
When the user moves focus to an element and presses Return, that
element is selected and is printed to standard output (or its index,
if
.B \-e
is used) and gsmenu terminates.  Elements can also be selected by
clicking on them with the mouse.  Additionally, the following keyboard
commands are recognised:
.TP
.B Any printable character
Appends the character to the text in the input field.  This works as a filter:
only items containing this text (possibly in a tag) will be displayed.
.TP
.B Backspace
Remove the last character in the input field, or if empty, open the
topmost filter for editing.
.TP
.B Left/Right/Up/Down (CTRL\-b/CTRL-f/CTRL\-p/CTRL\-n)
Move focus in the grid.
.TP
.B CTRL\-i
Solidify the current input as a filter, meaning that a new filter can be entered while the earlier will still apply.
.TP
.B CTRL\-o
Solidify the current input as an inverse filter, meaning that only
nonmatches will pass
.TP
.B CTRL\-a
Set focus to the leftmost element in the row.
.TP
.B CTRL\-e
Set focus to the rightmost element in the row.
.TP
.B CTRL\-s
Focus on the next element following a spiral path from the center.
.TP
.B CTRL\-r
Focus on the previous element following a spiral path from the center.
.TP
.B CTRL\-w
Remove the topmost filter, if any.
.TP
.B Escape
Cancel selection and exit gsmenu
.SH EXIT STATUS
gsmenu returns a
.B 0
exit status on success,
.B 1
if there was an internal problem, and
.B 2
if the user cancelled.
